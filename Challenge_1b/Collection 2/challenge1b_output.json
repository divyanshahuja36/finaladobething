Use ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening, editing, and printing. You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers. What is a digital signature? Digital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate documents, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign documents quickly and easily, and be confident that they can\u2019t be tampered with or forged. Why validate a digital signature? When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the signer and the signed content. Depending on how you\u2019ve configured your application, validation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the authenticity of the signature\u2019s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are trusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or Acrobat Reader settings. To verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after signing. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes. Set preferences for validating digital signatures You can set verification preferences in advance so digital signatures are valid when you open a PDF and verification details appear with the signature. When Digital Signatures are validated, an icon appears in the document message bar to indicate the signature status. 1. Select the hamburger menu (Windows\u00ae), or go to Acrobat (macOS)> Preferences. 2. In the Preferences dialog box, from under categories, select Signatures. 3. From the Verification box in the Digital Signatures panel, select More... 4. In the 'Signature Verification Preferences' dialog that opens, you can control the following settings: \u2022 Set automatic validation of signatures: With the Verify signatures when the document is opened check box selected, Acrobat automatically validates all signatures in a PDF when you open the document. \u2022 Set verification behavior: The options specify methods that determine which plug-in to choose when verifying a signature. The appropriate plug-in is often selected automatically. Contact your system administrator about specific plug-in requirements for validating signatures. \u2022 Check the revocation status of certificates: With the Require certificate revocation checking to succeed... checkbox selected, Acrobat checks certificates against a list of excluded certificates during validation. If you deselect the check box, the revocation status for Acrobat Approval signatures is ignored. The revocation status is always checked to certify signatures. \u2022 Use expired timestamps: The option is selected by default. It uses the time mentioned in the timestamp or embedded in the signature, even if the signature\u2019s certificate has expired. If you deselect the check box, Acrobat discards expired timestamps. \u2022 Set verification for time: You can select the appropriate options under 'Verification time' to check the time at which the signature was created, to check the timestamp embedded in the signature, or to check the current time. \u2022 Add verification information: Select appropriate options under 'Verification information' to add verification information to the signed PDF or to alert the user when the verification information is too large. \u2022 Configure to trust the root certificates in the Windows\u00ae certificate store: You can specify whether to trust all root certificates in the Windows\u00ae Certificates store for: \u2022 Validating signatures: Certificates are trusted for Acrobat Approval signature validation. \u2022 Validating certified documents: Certificates are trusted for certification signature validation.",
